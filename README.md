# SONARI

Brutally honest on-chain token scanner. Tells you: ENTER / WAIT / CUT.  
Built solo for EasyA Consensus Hong Kong 2026 – DeFi Track.

### Quick Demo
Watch 2-min:

### What it does
A prototype feels that scans tokens on RobinPump.fun-style bonding curves for wash trading, fake volume, rug signals.  
SONARI gives one clear verdict + cleanliness score so you don't FOMO into traps.

### Why I built it
Aren't we all tired of of getting rekt by manipulated pumps? I've wanted something that forces me to see the truth fast.

### Built with
- React / Next.js
- Tailwind + Framer Motion
- Solana/Base (Helius/Birdeye APIs)
- CoinGecko (free credits)

**How I used AI tools responsibly:**
- Grok — Generated some component skeletons and helped brainstorm UI flows.
- Figma AI — Quick layout ideas and mascot variations. (I reviewed every suggestion, fixed bugs, wrote the core risk scoring rules, integrated blockchain data, and made all final decisions. AI accelerated shipping; the project idea and execution are mine.)
