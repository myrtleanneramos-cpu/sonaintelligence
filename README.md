Hi, it's Myrtle Anne Ramos here I’m the one who built SONARI during the hackathon, and I want this to sound like me — not like some polished AI-generated thing.So I rewrote the main parts myself. This is how I actually talk and write when I’m excited about something I made. No fluff, no corporate voice, just straight-up how I would explain it to friends or on Twitter.What SONARI actually isSONARI is my attempt to stop getting rekt by obvious rugs and fake pumps.
It’s not another “AI assistant” that tells you sweet nothings.
It’s more like a brutally honest friend who just says:
“Yo this is sus, get out”
or
“This one actually looks good, go in.”I made it scan real on-chain stuff — volume that’s real vs fake, liquidity that suddenly disappears, weird wallet patterns that scream wash trading.
Then it spits out one clear call:
ENTER / WAIT / CUTThat’s it. No 500-word essay. Just the verdict, a cleanliness score, and why it thinks that.Why I built it this wayI’m tired of scrolling through 10 different tools, reading hype threads, and still losing money because I FOMO’d into something manipulated.
I wanted something that forces me to look at the ugly truth before I click buy.So SONARI doesn’t try to be cute or motivational.
The interface is dark, sharp, neon — like a terminal for traders who are done with games.
Only time it gets soft is when you actually win a trade — then the little chibi sun pops up like “hell yeah you did it” How it works (my quick version)Pulls live data (CoinGecko, Birdeye, whatever I could hook up in 48 hours)  
Looks for red flags: sudden volume spikes with no real buys, liquidity pulls, same wallets pumping-dump cycles  
Gives a score 0–100 (higher = cleaner)  
Decides ENTER if it smells real momentum, CUT if it smells trap, WAIT if it’s too messy to tell

Right now it’s mostly focused on the RobinPump.fun style stuff since that’s what the hackathon track wanted, but honestly I want to expand it to any Solana or Base token that’s moving fast.The vibe I was going forRuthless clarity.
No hopium.
No “this might moon” nonsense.
Just: is this clean or is this cooked?That’s why the tagline I keep coming back to is:“Clean or cut. Decide fast.”If you’re judging thisHey  I built this solo in the 48 hours.
I’m Myrtle Anne Ramos — frontend, a bit of backend, on-chain data wrangling, UI design, the whole thing.
First time doing a big blockchain hackathon like this.
I know it’s not perfect but I’m really proud I shipped something that actually feels useful to me.If you want the demo, I’ve got a Loom ready: [put link here]

Repo: public on GitHubThanks for taking a look.
Hope it doesn’t make you lose money — Myrtle
