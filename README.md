### Quick Demo
Watch 2-min:

### What it does
A prototype feels that scans tokens on RobinPump.fun-style bonding curves for wash trading, fake volume, rug signals.  
SONARI gives one clear verdict + cleanliness score so you don't FOMO into traps.

### Why I built it
Aren't we all tired of of getting rekt by manipulated pumps? I've wanted something that forces me to see the truth fast.

### Built with
- React / Next.js
- Tailwind + Framer Motion
- Solana/Base (Helius/Birdeye APIs)
- CoinGecko (free credits)
